# PRODIGY_CS_01
Task 1 of cybersecurity internship .

This Python script implements the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption technique where each letter in the text is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

Features

Encrypts messages using a shift value.

Decrypts messages by reversing the shift value.

Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Non-alphabet characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) remain unchanged.


How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Sinanmuhammed/PRODIGY_CS_01.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

4. Follow the prompts:

Enter whether you want to "encrypt" or "decrypt".

Input your message.

Provide the shift value (the number of positions to shift in the alphabet).




Example
